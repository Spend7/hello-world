# hello-world

Welcome to my Github page!

I created this profile to chronicle my growth as a programmer. I first started learning how to code on July 5th, 2017 and hope to make a career change into the world of software development. I've started learning SQL first since it is most applicable to my current job, but I would like to build on that knowledge to eventually become a full-stack dev.
